No matter where you are in the world, if you are in a university-level science or engineering program, there's going to be
some  "Stats 101" or intro-level stats course that you have to take. Supposedly it's a course that's supposed
to teach you the basics of how to use statistics in scientific research, but for the most part it fails miserably
at this intended goal. At every university I have ever been to and among the overwhelming majority of the people I have ever met,
the universal sentiment towards these courses can be described by something along the lines of "I hated statistics", "I suck at statistics", 
or both. But why is that? 

Well, in order for me to give my personal answer to that question, I have to give some context. I was not always a statistician and many years
ago, when I was doing my biochemistry degree, I was forced to take one of these intro-level stats courses. The particular course only really did
hypothesis tests and confidence intervals and not much else, and the entire time I was taking the course, I had absolutely no idea what was
going on. The professor went into virtually no detail of why you would use certain methods in certain situations, and it drove me completely nuts
trying to rationalize what was going on. I would end up trying to apply arbitrary hypothesis tests to questions on 
exams, and ended up doing quite poorly. So poorly in fact that if I got one percent lower, I would have been kicked out of my degree program. 

Years later, I found myself in an introductory statistics course at another university, starting over. But this course felt completely different.
The professor put a great deal of emphasis on the philosophical aspects of statistics, emphasizing the subjective and messy nature of statistics 
every step of the way. While we did learn a lot about hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, the professor consistently reinforced the idea
that they are not be suitable for certain types of problems, and that we should think carefully before choosing our statistical tools. This course
was arguably much more comprehensive and detailed than the previous intro-level stats course I took, but it was much easier for me and I ended
up actually enjoying the subject.

Looking back at these two sets of experiences, I am inclined to believe that the most important thing that someone can get from an intro stats course
is not the ability to do hypothesis tests. It is not whether or not someone can find a confidence interval. It has nothing to do with how good they
are at probability theory or math in general. And it is NOT whether someone can apply a cookie-cutter statistical
method to some problem. Rather, the most important thing that you can teach someone in an introductory statistics course is nuance. 

Based on my industry experiences, if I were a scientist in practice, my emphasis is going to be subject matter knowledge and not statistics. 
None of the calculations or computations you see on intro stats exams is going to matter all that much to a general research scientist, 
since it's going to be outsourced to a statistician or automated one way or another. What matters more than anything else to scientists is the ability 
to think for themselves. They need to be aware that statistics is subjective and they need to understand some of the philosophical rationale behind why 
you consider certain approaches in some situations while rejecting the same methodology in others. They need to understand that it is research and subject 
matter knowledge that guides statistical methodology, and not the other way around. In my opinion, as long as these aspects of statistics are taught to a 
reasonable extent, the math can wait. There is very little that is more damaging to research practice and scientific integrity than scientists who have an 
inflexible mentality towards statistics and thinks there's always a fixed, cookie-cutter way to do statistical inference. But that's a topic for another day.
