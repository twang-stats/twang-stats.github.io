So... after a bit of tinkering and not knowing anything at all about blogging, ruby, jekyll, 
or anything about how to set up a blog, I am here with a half-functioning website.

Anyways... where do I begin? Well I suppose I'll talk a bit about my journey and what the point of
this will be, starting with a bit about myself to put everything in context. 

I have worn a few different hats over the last few years. I started off with an undergraduate
degree in biochemistry, but came to the realization that I was not well-suited for medical school, lab work, 
or academia, so I picked a fourth-year research project that focused on eLearning and online learning. That eventually
got me a contract job in a tech company making online courses, but that proved to be unstable and as much as I would have
liked to stay in that line of work, I was not able to get anything secure and permanent. 

Now, in a stroke of serendipity, I ended up back in the sciences, working in a contract research company doing QC/QA work with more and more 
stataistics as time went on. This eventually led me to finishing a Master's degree in statistics after a few years of studying
part time and working full time. A bit ironic since statistics was by far my worst subject in undergraduate and 
that intro course almost cost me my scholarship! And that is where I find myself today - with a Master's degree in statistics and a series of 
work experiences that make me an oddball. 

While this oddball position has made me a perpetual outsider to everything I have ever experienced, I have found this to be a very eye-opening
position to be in. People with traditional backgrounds in given fields of study certainly have more expertise in those areas than oddballs
like me, for sure, but I have found over the years that not being locked to that traditional viewpoint allows me to sometimes catch serious
"blind spots" that others may miss. The point of this blog, then, is for me to record and log my perspectives on whatever comes to mind. 
Maybe you'll get something valuable out of all this. 


Somewhere along the way though, I need to figure out how to put functional controls on these pages...
